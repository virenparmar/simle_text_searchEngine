I refer to the letter, “Hold BTO prices, tighten subletting rules for more affordable housing shares this view” (March 20). Public flat owners who wish to sublet part of their flats should meet certain criteria to get approval.

These should be that they must have lived in the flat for more than five years, they must not exceed a certain annual income or are not working, or other reasons on a case-by-case basis. This could help to curb escalating resale prices and income inequality here.
